There should be at least two drives to have Linux on one drive and secoind drive to encrypt (Note: drive with running linux can not be encrypted!)

sudo apt-get install cryptsetup
# encrypt drive and set a password
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX

##The output:
##WARNING!
##========
##This will overwrite data on /dev/sdX irrevocably.
##Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
##Enter passphrase for /dev/sdX: <passphrase to encrypt disk>
##Verify passphrase: <passphrase to encrypt disk>

# Manually decrypt encrypted drive
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX encHome
# Enter passphrase for /dev/sdX: <passphrase to encrypt disk>

# Manually mount disk to /mnt/home  
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/encHome
sudo mkdir /mnt/home
sudo mount /dev/mapper/encHome /mnt/home
# Move content from /home to /mnt/home
sudo mv /home/* /mnt/home/
sudo umount /mnt/home/
sudo rmdir /mnt/home/
# Mount new drive to /home directory
sudo mount /dev/mapper/encHome /home/
####### Note: this procedure is needed, cause /home already exists and mounting drive on /home will do the "shadowing" and system will not see the real content of /home, but was is mounted and it can be crucial for the system to work

###### Configure encryption/decryption to be automatic during start up #####
### each time it is needed to manually decrypt the drive and mount it.
# Configuration, so that decryption of the drive and mount will be done at the start up (<passphrase to encrypt disk> should be supplied):
# Get data from the disk
sudo blkid | grep /dev/sdX
> /dev/sdX: UUID="8cf3682d-4293-4d99-ac3d-c970788a4add" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
# add next lines to the following config (might be no permission to files without sudo) UUID from previous step
echo -e 'encryptedHome\tUUID=8cf3682d-4293-4d99-ac3d-c970788a4add\tnone\tluks' >>/etc/crypttab
echo -e '/dev/mapper/encryptedHome\t/home/\text4\tdefaults\t0\t2' >>/etc/fstab
reboot
## Done
